### Conditional Directives with Vue.js

**The ability to show or hide elements based on conditions is a fundamental feature of any frontend framework. Vue.js provides us with a set of core directives to achieve this effect: v-if, v-else, v-else-if and v-show.**

### Directives
In Vue, two-way binding is accomplishe using the **v-model** directives.
It can be used well with Binding to Checkboxes and Radio Buttons 
```javascript
<div id="app">
<h1>{{message}}</h1>
<input type="text" v-model="message" />
</div>

<script>
var app = new Vue({
el: '#app'
data:{
message:'Hello'
}
})
</script>
```

 
 
### Vue Instance
Every Vue application starts by creating a new Vue instance with Vue function:
```javascript
var vm = new Vue({
//options
})
```
